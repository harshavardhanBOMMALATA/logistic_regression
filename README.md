# logistic_regression
---

This project offers a thorough exploration of **Logistic Regression**, guiding learners from beginner to advanced levels through clear explanations and practical examples. The primary objective is to not only understand the theoretical foundations of logistic regression but also to apply it to real-world problems. Through hands-on experience, learners will manually implement logistic regression using **Python**, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries, enabling a deep understanding of the underlying math and logic. The project covers both **binary classification** and **multiclass classification**, providing insight into how logistic regression can be used for tasks like spam detection, disease prediction, and customer churn analysis. Throughout the tutorial, real-world use cases are explored, and key concepts such as **model evaluation**, **cost functions**, and **optimization** are discussed in detail. Visualizations, including decision boundaries and graphical representations of model performance, will help learners see how logistic regression classifies data and makes predictions. By the end of this project, participants will have built a complete logistic regression model from scratch, gained an understanding of its practical applications, and developed the confidence to move on to more advanced machine learning algorithms.
