---

This project offers a thorough exploration of **Logistic Regression**, guiding learners from beginner to advanced levels through clear explanations and practical examples. The primary objective is to not only understand the theoretical foundations of logistic regression but also to apply it to real-world problems. Through hands-on experience, learners will manually implement logistic regression using **Python**, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries, enabling a deep understanding of the underlying math and logic. The project covers both **binary classification** and **multiclass classification**, providing insight into how logistic regression can be used for tasks like spam detection, disease prediction, and customer churn analysis. Throughout the tutorial, real-world use cases are explored, and key concepts such as **model evaluation**, **cost functions**, and **optimization** are discussed in detail. Visualizations, including decision boundaries and graphical representations of model performance, will help learners see how logistic regression classifies data and makes predictions. By the end of this project, participants will have built a complete logistic regression model from scratch, gained an understanding of its practical applications, and developed the confidence to move on to more advanced machine learning algorithms.

## 📘 Introduction to Logistic Regression

**Definition**:
Logistic Regression is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used primarily for **classification tasks**. While traditional regression gives outputs ranging from **−∞ to +∞**, logistic regression applies the **sigmoid function** to map these values into the range **0 to 1**, making it suitable for predicting probabilities.

### 💡 Why "Regression" in Classification?

Even though the goal is classification, the algorithm initially computes a **continuous value** using a linear equation:

$$
z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \ldots + b
$$

This output `z` is then passed through the **sigmoid function** to squash it into a probability between 0 and 1:

$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

### 📚 What is Supervised Learning?

Logistic regression is a **supervised learning model**, meaning it learns from **labeled data** — where both input features and correct output labels are already known.

> 🧠 Example:
> A dataset containing features like `study_hours`, `sleep_hours`, and the label `verdict` (Pass or Fail). The model learns from this structured data to predict outcomes on unseen inputs.

### 🔄 Regression vs. Logistic Regression

* **Linear Regression** is used for predicting **continuous values** (e.g., price, temperature).
* **Logistic Regression** is used for **classification** by applying a regression-like linear combination and then using **sigmoid** to output probabilities.

### 🧭 Types of Logistic Regression

1. **Binary Classification** – Two output classes (e.g., Pass/Fail, Yes/No)
2. **Multiclass Classification** – More than two output classes (e.g., Low/Medium/High)

We’ll explore both types in the following sections.
